# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)


In this assignment, i've  created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
